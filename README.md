# Virtual-Trial-Room
AI-powered Virtual Dressing Room with pose estimation and hand-gesture controls


Project Overview

The Virtual Dressing Room is an AI-powered system that allows users to try outfits digitally in real-time. Using pose estimation and hand-gesture controls, the system overlays selected clothing onto the userâ€™s live image, creating an interactive and immersive experience.

The project is designed to help fashion businesses showcase their collections digitally, reducing dependency on physical trials and enhancing customer engagement. Integration with a local fashion company in Bangalore is currently in process, aiming to provide a product-ready solution for small and medium fashion retailers.

The system is developed with Python and OpenCV/MediaPipe, focusing on real-time performance, accuracy of overlay, and intuitive user interaction. The underlying code is kept private for internal use and prototype development.
